Submodels UnityData, OperationalData and PlcCommunication and Asset Administration Shells for parts of production line were created using <a href="https://github.com/admin-shell-io/aasx-package-explorer">AASX Package Explorer</a>.

Submodels Nameplate, HandoverDocumentation and TechnicalData are freely available, maintained and distributed by <a href="https://industrialdigitaltwin.org/en/content-hub/submodels">Industrial Digital Twin Association</a>.

Informations about production line parts included in AAS were augmented with SemanticIds proposed by <a href="https://eclass.eu/en/eclass-standard/search-content">ECLASS</a> or Concept Descriptions to allow further semantic interoperability.
